Introduction:
-------------

Provman is a middleware component that simplifies the process of writing
device management clients.  It reduces code duplication on devices that
need to support multiple device management clients and it isolates these
clients from changes to the underlying middleware.  There are many device
management use cases, e.g., Provisioning, Lock and Wipe, Diagnostics,
firmware update, etc.  Provman is concerned with the first of these use
cases, i.e., Provisioning.

Compiling Provman:
-----------------

Provman is documented using doxygen.  Before you can access this
documentation you need to build it.  You can do so by building provman.

Provman has a number of direct dependencies, currently glibc, glib, gio,
libedataserver, gconf and camel.  Development versions of these packages
must be installed before it can be compiled.  On Meego the relevant
packages can be installed as follows:

sudo zypper install doxygen (if you want to build the docs)
sudo zypper install gcc-c++
sudo zypper install glib2-devel
sudo zypper install evolution-data-server-devel

Once you have installed the dependencies, cd to the provman directory and
type

autoreconf -i
./configure
make
sudo make install

Once the build is finished please consult, doc/doxygen/html/index.html for
more information.
