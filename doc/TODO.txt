* Implement Abort Command

  Abort allows a client to cancel any modifications it has made during its 
  management session.  Abort must be called after Start has been called but
  before End.  Abort like End terminates the session.  However, the changes
  made during the session are discarded and are not passed to the plugins.

* Verify that End is asynchronous

  The End command should not return until all the plugins have returned
  from their sync out functions.  Is this happening?

* Introspection

  Need to add an introspection interface so that clients can discover which
  settings are available and which values they can assume.

* Meta data
 
  Need to allow meta data to be associated with settings.  Needed for OMA DM
  and OMA CP.

EDS Plugin:

* Implement validate_set

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model

SyncE Plugin:

* Implement validate_set

* Add RemoteDeviceId parameter

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model

oFono Plugin

* Check the use of cancellable in the oFono plugin.

  Do we really need to destroy the cancellable object and create a new one
  each time we invoke an asynchronous command.

* Listen to notifications and update internal data model
